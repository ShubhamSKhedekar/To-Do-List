# To-Do-List
<div>A to-do list is just a list of things you have to-do. That means basically anything and everything can be on your to-do listâ€”but just because you've written your to-dos down doesn't mean your to-do list is actually useful. Effectively tracking when your work is due can help you prioritize and get great work done.</div>

<h3>Task Assoiated in making ToDo list</h3>

<h3>What are the benefits of a daily to-do list?</h3>
<div>
<p>
<b>Increases productivity: </b>
At work and at home, having a to-do list may help you prioritize your work and personal tasks. This allows you to organize and complete the most crucial tasks first. To-do lists can be used to improve time management because all of your tasks are laid out clearly in advance. You can more easily decide what to do after you complete a task and move on to the next item on the list.</p>

<p>
<b>Improves memory: </b>
Creating and maintaining a daily to-do list can help improve your overall memory by reinforcing your short-term memory. By writing tasks and short-term goals and continually checking the list, you might retain more information. Making a list every day can improve memory and may assist you in making sure all your important tasks get completed on time.</p>

<p>
<b>Reduces anxiety and improves mental health: </b>
Being able to reduce anxiety is an important part of a balanced life. Organizing your schedule with a to-do list can improve your mental health by resolving uncertainty and allowing you to see all the activities you plan to accomplish throughout the day. The act of completing tasks can also provide an ego boost, reassuring you of your capabilities. The satisfaction of checking a task off your list and moving toward a new goal can increase your self-confidence. Having higher self-esteem can improve your overall mental health and provide a better outlook on life.</p>

<p>
<b>Provides a sense of accomplishment: </b>
Completing tasks and having a physical action, such as crossing them off a list, can provide a sense of accomplishment. Accomplishing a task can boost morale and improve productivity. Even if it's as simple as making your bed, completing a task is a powerful motivator for many people.</p>

<p>
<b>Prioritize your goals: </b>
Make sure to start by writing down the most urgent items or tasks you can accomplish easily. For example, if you have an important meeting to attend, you can list those first. Or perhaps you may begin by delivering a report that has a tight deadline. After writing down the crucial tasks, you can then move on to the less important goals. To avoid overloading your to-do list, sort all the tasks by level of priority. </p>
